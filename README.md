This project is a classic 2D platformer inspired by the Mario series, built using Unity. The game features fundamental mechanics like movement, jumping, and dodging hazards. Navigate through levels filled with ghosts that you must avoid as you make your way towards the final boss. The final challenge involves an epic showdown with an animated boss that attacks by shooting a beam from its mouth. After successfully dodging the boss's attacks, players can grab a sword that appears in the center of the arena to deliver the final blow and complete the game.
